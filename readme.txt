1. Task Manager App - MVVM Pattern
Objective: Build a simple desktop application using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.
Description: Create a task manager app where users can add, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have properties like title, description, due date, and priority. Implement features like filtering tasks by priority or due date.
Focus: The MVVM pattern will help you separate the business logic (Model), user interface (View), and application logic (ViewModel).
